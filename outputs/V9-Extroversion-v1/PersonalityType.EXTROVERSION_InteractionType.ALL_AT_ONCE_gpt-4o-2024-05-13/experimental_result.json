She is a natural leader during meetings, often taking charge and encouraging others to share their ideas. Her desk is a hub of activity, with colleagues frequently stopping by to discuss projects or just to chat.\n\nMaria excels in her role due to her ability to network and build relationships. She frequently attends industry events, not just for professional growth but because she genuinely enjoys meeting new people and exchanging ideas.

Her sociability, assertiveness, high activity level, excitement seeking, and positive emotions define her character. She thrives on interaction and activity, making her a natural fit for roles and environments that require constant engagement with people.
